# Subsequent actual-inference recommendation candidate

Current audit (28 October 2026): this local candidate is based on dev/aarya at 4fabe98 plus uncommitted guided-flow work. 197 Python tests pass. Real BGE embeddings and the authenticated recommendation route have passed on synthetic temporary data. The live app has prepared assets but its saved catalog has no future offers; no ranking can run until there are candidates. The redundant browser MiniLM feature was removed because its execution was unverified. Browser rendering and real multi-buyer Sandbox acceptance remain pending. See Aarya_changes.md.

# Historical recommendation-candidate and UI-first snapshots

These paragraphs record earlier implementation evidence and are superseded by the current audit above. The original Slice 3 payment invariants and route contracts remain in scope.

Historical snapshot: the user authorized a visual redesign and key-free AI, then scoped publication primarily as UI improvement on `Aruisop/PayPal-Hackathon` branch `dev/aarya`. At that time, the proposal described a light/navy guided workspace, on-device MiniLM semantic discovery, private Plan Rescue and AI ordering of verified proposals. Those claims and the associated 132-test evidence describe an earlier snapshot; the current implementation and evidence are recorded above and in [the current handoff](../Aarya_changes.md).

The original-style integration review below is historical evidence; its design restriction is superseded by the user's explicit redesign request.

# Slice 3 original-UI integration review

Date: 18 October 2026. Base: Panchadip-128's slice/3-collaborative-booking-and-equal-payments at 41ec3d7. Status: review candidate, not accepted or deployed.

The original discovery, seat canvas, wallet card, sounds, workshop flow and Judge Hub are preserved. The group room now connects actual preference contracts, saved shared discussion, independent buyer approval, exact quotes, verified capture evidence and durable recovery. Details and provenance are in [Aarya_changes.md](../Aarya_changes.md).

Reproduced blockers corrected: frontend interpretation field-name mismatch; invented defaults/98% consensus/first-catalog fallback; missing buyer approval before authorization; pending captures issuing tickets; failed refund/void hidden behind cancellation; demo writes changing saved inventory; decorative QR/scanner claiming signature validation.

Reused reviewed backend modules and their tests from the archived correction; retained and integrated the original public UI. The new public/room.js separates real session-owned coordination from the original public/app.js navigation/workshops and public/demo.js fictional lab. No financial data or credentials were restored from the archive.

Revision 4 adds durable group operations/workflows and quarantines legacy unverified purchases. Revision 5 adds shared messages. Existing rows are preserved. Applied migrations remain unchanged. Known and unknown provider outcomes are reconciled; failed/unknown compensation retains inventory and remains visible. Captures are sequential, not an atomic settlement.

Validation: 125 Python tests passed in 31.492 seconds with temporary SQLite and mocked providers; frontend bootstrap/room/SDK contracts and 12 isolated demo checks passed. Dependency, syntax, static-ID and duplicate-ID checks passed. The browser tool failed to initialize (kernel-assets error 3), so rendered desktop/mobile, keyboard behavior, actual SDK windows and real multi-buyer payment evidence remain outstanding. Real Gemini and PostgreSQL runtime are unverified.

Review priorities: compare the original UI diff; run all checks; inspect pending/unknown evidence and failed compensation; verify identity/privacy across browser profiles and group switches; test a genuine Sandbox group; verify reload and durable recovery; check mobile/keyboard; test PostgreSQL before hosting. The lab must never mutate saved application data. Private QR/checking does not establish real venue admission, signing or wallet integration.

Historical Slice 1/2 evidence and original PRD are preserved. No commit, push, merge, external acceptance, production approval or deployment has been performed.
